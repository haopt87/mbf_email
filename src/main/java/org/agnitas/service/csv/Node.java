/**
 * Node used by <code>BeanBuilder</code> to track the pushing/popping of bean properties.
 * <p>
 * A node is primarily defined by:
 * <ul>
 * <li>context - the target of the node, ie the JavaBean/collection onto which node operations will be applied</li>
 * <li>name - the name of the node, ie the JavaBean property name dictating how node operations will be applied to the
 * <i>parent</i> context</li>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Nodes have basic operations performed on them:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A text value can be set - this will typically affect the node's value although for nodes representing beans or
 * collections this will not be the case</li>
 * <li>A value can be retrieved - for JavaBean/collection nodes this will be the target bean or collection, for other nodes
 * this will probably be dependent on the textual value previously set</li>
 * <li>A value can be applied to the context - for JavaBean nodes this will set a property of the JavaBean, for collections
 * this will add a value to that collection</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The methods of a node correspond to BeanBuilder events as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>push - an appropriate node type is created</li>
 * <li>apply - the text value is set on the node (and an appropriate value created if necessary)</li>
 * <li>pop - the node is popped from the head of the stack and its value is applied to <i>its parent node</i></li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
